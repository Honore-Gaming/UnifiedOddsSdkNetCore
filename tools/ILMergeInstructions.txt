Download ilmerge, if you dont have it, from the official site:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mbarnett/

Install ILMerge to the following folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\ILMerge\

1. Correct DoNotInternalize.txt with the list of namespaces or exact classes which you do NOT want to be internalized
2. run merge.bat file

Notice: 
since the new combined file is named Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK, 
the oddsFeedSection section type, in the DemoProject's config file, should be changed also.

May be:
^((?!Internal).)*$   - regular expression (to exclude everything in the '.Internal' namespace)
Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Entities.REST.*		- namespace with asterix
Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Entities.REST.IMatch	- full class name
